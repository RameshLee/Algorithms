**Recruiter feedback:** Did very well in all the interviews.

**Preparation:**
This is my first FAANG interview. The overall prepping time was around 3 months. Therefore, the below prepping duration for each topic could overlap.  In summary, grasping up the problem patterns, practicising solid LP stories, mock interviews, and identifying the overlap between system design questions are crucial.
1) **DS & Algo basics:** (duration: 1 month)
    - Textbook: Algorithms by Sanjay Dasgupta. Online resources: geeksforgeeks, programiz, techiedelight, etc.
    - Tips:
		- Reading a full textbook is not essential, but it is great to understand the conceptual depths from their roots.
		-  There are also other textbooks such as Algorithms design manual by Skiena & Introduction to algorithms by Cormen.
		-  If you have a rather less preparation time, revise with crash courses using the above free online resources.

2) **Problem-solving:** (duration: 3 months)
    - Leetcode (158 easy + 196 medium + 24 hard = 378 problems, in 3 months).
    - Attended 10 weekly LC contests to emulate the time-sensitive interview experience.
    - Completed all explore cards + amazon interview card in leetcode.
    - Tips:
		- Solve & keep revising the most famous or your favorite questions.
		- Leverage the "list" feature in LC to group your favorites/qns worth revising.
		-  For any problem, first implement a working solution. Afterwards, review the most-voted solutions and implement them by yourself.
		-  Try to solve the same problem using all available methods (e.g. disjointSet/dfs/bfs, recursion/iteration, memoization/tabulation).
		-   Picking up the problem patterns are far more important than solving a lot of problems. LC explore cards did help me there!
		-   You can perhaps use a github repo to store your answers in a separate folder for each topic/pattern.
		-   Moreover, all my interview questions were the novel variations of the LC question patterns.
		-   During the interview, think out loud. Never ever stop talking. It is you talking to yourself, not to the interviewer.
		-   Because, if you silently steer your code in a wrong direction, then it gets far worse for the interviewer to provide a good hint and for you to pickup that hint & redesign your solution.

3) **System Design:** (duration: 1 month)
    - Grkkking the OOD & sys design.
    - Tips:
		- Prepare notes & keep revising. Again, pick up the patterns between the system design questions/solutions.
		- If you have the time, dive deep into each crucial system design components (e.g. CDN, Consistent-hashing, etc.)
		- In case of value for money, LC subscription is far more worth than the Grkkking.
		- But alas, there is no system design course here. Besides, I do not know any other equally well-curated course on system design.

4) **LPs:** (duration: 2 weeks)
    - Tailored 12 rock solid stories & tagged them with all suitable amazon LPs.
    - All my LP questions were from the most asked amazon LPs post in leetcode.
    - Tips:
		- Smile! Talk naturally like it is a discussion with your colleague, but not with an interviewer/manager of your dream company.
		- Clearly highlight that you "exceeded" expectations with key performance indicators for each LP situation.
		- If you are not a natural speaker, then it is very important to repeatedly rehearse/practice your answers in STAR pattern.
		- Keep a short notes on the keywords of all your stories and you can glance at them during the interview itself. These keywords should help you to recall the story if you get stuck.
		- I feel it is more realistic to prepare 10-15 solid stories and tag them with all relevant amazon LPs. Definitely more realistic than trying to prepare answers for 40-50 different LP questions and assessing the quality of those answers.
		- During the interview, you can adapt/improvise your answer for any question based on these stories.
		- But, do not repeat a story more than twice. Get ready to answer the follow-ups.
		- Important: Bar-raiser could easily spot if you stumble during the follow ups while answering perfectly for the initial question. Therefore, try to not lie.
		- Finally, watch a lot of undercover cop movies to assess how the cop survives when he gets cornered! ;)

This is my first FAANG interview. I am not a great coder. Just stayed consistent in my preparation over the last 3 months. Besides, I am from an electrical engineering background, which is why I required fullscale textbook revisions + lots of practice. If I could make it, then I believe anyone could make it to FAANG. Hereby, I would like to give back to the LC community by sharing my experience in detail. I will share offer details in a separate post. Thank you, LC community! Happy coding, and do not give up! :)

**Offer:** Received offer in 48 hours. (May 24, 2022)

My Preparation (3 months):
	- Textbook: Algorithms by Dasgupta. (1 month)
	- Leetcode (158 easy + 196 medium + 24 hard = 378 problems, in 3 months).
	- Attended 10 weekly LC contests to emulate the time-sensitive interview experience. (2 months)
	- Prepared 10-12 rock solid stories & tagged them all relevant amazon LPs. ( 2 weeks).
	- Grkkking course for the system design. (1 month)

My Observations:
	- Identifying patterns between questions rather than trying to solve a lot of questions.
	- Consistently take part in LC weekly contests after you're somewhat confident with all DS topics.
	- LPs are super important, especially for amazon. Do mock interviews if you're not natural speaker.
	- System design is essential if you want to clear SDE 2, otherwise they could downgrade level.

// 250k+ total?

// base salary, performance bonus, stock grant
// relocation package, signing bonus, any other perks?
// salary at hand? any unknown deductions?
// location: vancouver/toronto?, team: middle mile routing?, WFH?
// question: how long it takes from sde 2 to sde 3?
// working hours, how strict is office presence?

budget problem replies:
// based on market research, speaking to colleagues, my expected salary range for my background is this.
// I am sure you may need to talk to higher authority. Would love to see if you can raise to this amount.
// Just to ensure that I payback loans/PR initial amount: like to invest myself at amazon for the long run.
// Dont want to look others. helpful for us both.
// 1) very specialized routing experience, PHD degree, lots of experience.
// 2) to bridge the gap: sign on bonus or any other package?
// 3) performance review after 3-6 months and then bump the salary?
// 4) can we adjust vacation days?
// informal offer letter?


// 1) salary => [minimum, happyNumber]
// 2) talk about salary, equity, vacation time.
// 3) Can we round that salary to whole amount? :)
// 4) Thank you for that. But I would be really excited to accept this higher amount. considering specialized experience and fit.
// 5) I am looking for a competitive offer. And, for me, that's around this amount. Is there any way to get closer to that? :)
// 6) That's a little lesser than what I was expecting. I was thinking closer to 180k. Can we meet in the middle?
// 7) How high can you go? :)
// 8) I would love to join. This is my no.1 company. But, the compensation is too lower than my minimum.
// 9) I am very excited about this position. But, this compensation doesn't work for me.
// Is there anything you can do? Anyone you could talk to? Can you get back tomorrow or later this week?
// I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much.
// 10) with my 6 YOE and specialized experience + fit as talking with HR, I feel like I'm uniquely positioned to help routing team.
// Is there any way we can get closer to the industry benchmark?

First FAANG interview.
1) DS & Algo:
    - Textbook: Algorithms by Sanjay Dasgupta. Online resources: geeksforgeeks, programiz, etc.
1) Problem-solving:
    - Leetcode (158 easy + 196 medium + 24 hard = 378 problems, in 3 months).
    - Attended all weekly LC contests after prepping 1 month.
    - Completed all explore cards + amazon interview card in leetcode.
    Tips: solve & revise occasionally. solve both iterative & recursive whenever possible. Review the most-voted solutions.
2) LLD & HLD:
    - Gr*kking the OOD interview and Gr*kking the system design interview.
    Tips: prepare notes & keep revising. pick up patterns b/w questions. read more about crucial system design components. (e.g. CDN, hashing)
3) LPs:
    - Dan Croiter to get a general idea on LPs & STAR pattern.
    - Tailored 10 solid stories & tagged them with suitable amazon LPs.
    - All LPs were from here. https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/437082/Amazon-Behavioral-questions-or-Leadership-Principles-or-LP
    Tips: Smile & be confident. never tell failure to any LP. tell how you exceeded expectations on each LP situation.

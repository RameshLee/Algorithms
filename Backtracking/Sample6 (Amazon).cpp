// Preparation
First FAANG interview.
1) DS & Algo:
    - Textbook: Algorithms by Sanjay Dasgupta. Online resources: geeksforgeeks, programiz, etc.
1) Problem-solving:
    - Leetcode (158 easy + 196 medium + 24 hard = 378 problems, in 3 months).
    - Attended all weekly LC contests after prepping 1 month.
    - Completed all explore cards + amazon interview card in leetcode.
    Tips: solve & revise occasionally. solve both iterative & recursive whenever possible. Review the most-voted solutions.
2) LLD & HLD:
    - Gr*kking the OOD interview and Gr*kking the system design interview.
    Tips: prepare notes & keep revising. pick up patterns b/w questions. read more about crucial system design components. (e.g. CDN, hashing)
3) LPs:
    - Dan Croiter to get a general idea on LPs & STAR pattern.
    - Tailored 10 solid stories & tagged them with suitable amazon LPs.
    - All LPs were from here. https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/437082/Amazon-Behavioral-questions-or-Leadership-Principles-or-LP
    Tips: Smile & be confident. never tell failure to any LP. tell how you exceeded expectations on each LP situation.

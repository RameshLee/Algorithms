// Location: Vancouver, Canada
// YOE: PhD + 2 years.

//  OA
Q1: LC Medium (linked list + recursion)
Q2: LC Medium (dynamic programming)

// On-site
Round 1: 30 min LP, 30 min coding (DS)
    - LC Medium (priority_queue + custom comparator). Solved perfectly.
    - LC Medium (hashMap + set + custom comparator). Solved perfectly.

Round 2: 20 min LP, 40 min coding (Problem-solving)
    - LC Medium/Hard (dynamic disjoint set with path compression + graph traversal). Solved perfectly.
    - LC Medium (hashMap or two-pointers). Famous problem. Immediately gave O(N^3) solution, but O(N^2) is optimal.

Round 3: 30 min LP, 30 min coding (LLD)
    - Medium (polymorphism + inheritance + pure virtual function). Solved perfectly.

Round 4: 60 min LP (bar-raiser)
    - All LPs, and grilling follow ups on both technical & behavioral aspects of my answers. Felt like I did very well!

Round 5: 60 min LP, 30 min system design (HLD)
    - Medium from Gr*kking the system design course. Solved perfectly.

// Preparation
This is my first FAANG interview.
1) DS & Algo basics: (duration: 1 month)
    - Textbook: Algorithms by Sanjay Dasgupta. Online resources: geeksforgeeks, programiz, techiedelight, etc.
    Tips: Reading a full textbook is not essential, but it is great to understand the conceptual depths from their roots.
          If you have a rather less preparation time, revise with crash courses on the above free online resources.

2) Problem-solving: (duration: 3 months)
    - Leetcode (158 easy + 196 medium + 24 hard = 378 problems, in 3 months).
    - Attended 10 weekly LC contests to emulate the time-sensitive interview experience.
    - Completed all explore cards + amazon interview card in leetcode.
    Tips: Solve & keep revising the most famous or your favorite questions. Make use of the "list" feature in LC.
          Implement some working solution. Then, review the most-voted solutions and implement them by yourself.
          Try to solve the same question using all available methods (e.g. disjointSet/graph, recursion/iteration, memoization/tabulation).
          Picking up question patterns are far more important than solving more problems. LC explore cards did help me there!
          Moreover, all my interview questions are the novel variations of the LC question patterns.
          During the interview, think out loud. Never ever stop talking. It is you talking to yourself, not to the interviewer.
          Because, if you are silently coding in a wrong direction, then it gets far worser for the interviewer to provide a good hint and for you to pickup the hint & redesign the solution.

3) LLD & HLD: (duration: 1 month)
    - Gr*kking the OOD interview and Gr*kking the system design interview.
    Tips: Prepare notes & keep revising. Again, pick up the patterns between the system design questions.
          If you have time, dive deep into the details of each crucial system design components (e.g. CDN, Consistent-hashing, etc.)
          In case of value for money, LC subscription is far more worth than the Gr*kking course.
          But alas, there is no system design course here. Besides, I do not know any other equally well-curated system design course.

4) LPs: (duration: 2 weeks)
    - Dan Croitor YouTube channel helped to get a general idea on LPs & STAR pattern.
    - Tailored 12 rock solid stories & tagged them with all suitable amazon LPs.
    - All LPs were from here. https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/437082/Amazon-Behavioral-questions-or-Leadership-Principles-or-LP
    Tips: Smile! Talk naturally like it is a discussion with your colleague, not with an interviewer/manager of your dream company.
          Clearly show that you "exceeded" expectations with key performance indicators for each LP situation.
          If you are not a natural speaker, then it is essential to rehearse/practice each answer several times.
          Keep a short note about all your stories and you can glance at them during the interview itself.
          I feel it is more realistic to prepare 10-15 solid stories and tag them with relevant amazon LPs.
          Adapt and improvise your answer for any question based on these stories. Do not repeat a story more than twice.

OA: Online Assessment, LP: Leadership Principles, LLD: Low level design, HLD: High-level design, LC: Leetcode, DS: Data structures, OOD: Objected oriented design, STAR: Situation Task Action Result.

This is my first FAANG interview. I am not a great coder. Just stayed consistent in my preparation over the last 3 months.
I would like to give back to the LC community by sharing my experience in detail and answering any questions in the comments section.
Thank you all! Happy coding and do not give up! :)
